A small tool to streamline & automate the recording/compressing process in IW3MVM.

- Installation:
   Place the contents of autoavi.rar in your CoD4 root directory.

 - Usage:
   Launch "autoavi.exe" and setup your output directory, mod, and additonal launch options. (Leave launch options blank if none)
   
 - Known Issues:
  if selecting a demo with a "+" character in it's name on launch, the demo may fail to load. pressing Shift+G will open the selection gui with the previously     selected demo in the selection field, so it's not a huge problem.

   SHIFT+BACKSLASH" | START RECORDING 
    
   "R" | STOP RECORDING 
   
   "SHIFT+G" | SELECT NEW DEMO
